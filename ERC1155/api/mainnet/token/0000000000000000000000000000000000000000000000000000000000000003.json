{"id":3,"name":"DreamFNG","description":"The gif above is not the actual artpiece. The actual file is 58secs and a small version can be seen on www.dreamfng.com. DreamFNG is an original. The only of its kind. And will always be the only one of its kind. It’s not intended for the traditional art market nor the traditional expectation of what art is or should be. DreamFNG is a key, the doors it unlocks are hidden and will only be open at given times to certain people. The winner of this auction will be chosen to be part of this group of certain people.

DreamFNG is a mixture between the best contemporary art and music by Jonas Quant voiced by BETSY, with the support of Joel Borg from Borg & Lundell and Daniel Daboczy, backed by the Singapore Based Digital Assets and Blockchain Specialists: Technicorum Group.","image":"https://thekingswap.github.io/ERC1155/api/mainnet/video/3.gif","image_data":"https://thekingswap.github.io/ERC1155/api/mainnet/video/3.gif"}
