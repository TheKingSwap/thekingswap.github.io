{"id":3,"name":"DreamFNG","description":"DreamFNG is an original. The only of its kind. And will always be the only one of its kind. It’s not intended for the traditional art market nor the traditional expectation of what art is or should be. DreamFNG is a key, the doors it unlocks are hidden and will only be open at given times to certain people. The winner of this auction will be chosen to be part of this group of certain people, but that is not certain. But it can be. DreamFNG doesn’t have a start nor end, no given purpose nor scope. It exists because it wants, because it needs and because it is. Because it can. Because it’s art. DreamFNG is the first Swedish NFT, a mixture between the best contemporary art and music by Jonas Quant with the support of Borg & Lundell and Daniel Daboczy, backed by the Singapore Based Digital Assets and Blockchain Specialists: Technicorum Group. The auction starts on Friday the 26th of March 2021 and will be open for 48 hours. The NFT will be sold to the highest bidder and payment can be made via crypto- or traditional fiat currency. The link to the auction will be sent to those who sign up.","image":"https://thekingswap.github.io/ERC1155/api/mainnet/video/3.mov","image_data":"https://thekingswap.github.io/ERC1155/api/mainnet/video/3.mov"}
